# Parallax-PhotoGraphy-Site
This is a script that makes it easy for you to set up a site that uses parallax scrolling as its main effect. A parallax site concists of items in different layers that move with different speeds, to give the illusion of depth.

How it works
The script is controlled mostly from HTML and CSS. You specify layers in your markup and position them in CSS. You set HTML5 data attributes on each layer to let the script know about them. That is also where you specify the speed for the layer.

Image Source
The images i have added on this project, that is the link from unsplash.com ,you just have to paste the link in url. And more interesting thing in that is ,whenever you reload the page the images will changes everytime by set category.

Technologies Used: HTML CSS.
